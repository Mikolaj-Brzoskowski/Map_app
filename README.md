# Map_app

## To Do
### ~~Backend (not needed)~~
- ~~connecting to .HERE Geolocal API and markers on map~~
### Frontend
- ~~pages with routing~~
- ~~form for starting/ending point~~
- page with calculations:
    - ~~map (drawing route TODO)~~
    - ~~data about calculation~~
    - ~~cost input (saving into variable TODO)~~
    - ~~pdf download (TODO fix ratio and map not adding to PDF)~~ (sometimes doesnt generate calc values - pdf scale depends on map scale/position (?) )
    - maybe adding route instructions to map/pdf
- ~~routes history~~:
    - ~~interface~~
    - ~~saving history until page is refreshed (use of state(???))~~
### Tests
- literally everything
